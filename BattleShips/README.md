# BattleShips
A program made to simulate a [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game with networking capabilities. 
This was a collaborative two week project for CS342 Fall 2017 Software Design at UIC.

## How to:
1. Launch two instances of the game (first instance is defaulted as the server)
2. Begin placing aircrafts on the shipGrid (right most grid) for the server side and the   
   client side.
3. Take turns attacking using the attack grid (left most grid).
### Notes
 - Instructions are given on the status bar 
 - Connection happens automatically when the first move is made.
 - needs to have the ship grid of both client and server to be able to attack.
## Lessons Learned
 - Created UML Diagrams to organize design ideas
 - Use model-view-controller design pattern 
 - Familiarize with Agile Developement
 - Develop a GUI using the Java Swing Library
# Authors
