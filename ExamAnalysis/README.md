# Exam Analysis
A GUI app that reads exam scores from a set of input files, and does some simple analysis using F#. 
The GUI was provided, and I just had to write the back-end F# that performs the analysis.
## Lessons Learned
 - Use F# for simple data analysis: average, min, max, standard deviation, etc
 - Familiarize with how functional programming languages work
 - F# does everything with lists
 - Pattern matching in F#
 - Functional programming languages make it easier to analyze data compared to some imparative languages
