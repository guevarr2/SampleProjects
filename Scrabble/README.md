# Scrabble
A program that lists words you can make given a set of characters. The program displays a list of words sorted by score of 
each word in decreasing order. Also has a functionality to find specific words with specificcharacters. For example "e**h", 
where * (star) is any character.
## Lessons Learned
I learned how to use F# to find words in a dictionary. I became more familiar with how functional programming languages work.
And I also learned how to create recursive functinos that won't overflow the satck.
